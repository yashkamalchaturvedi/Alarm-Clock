## Installation

You will need to download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), a Microsoft code editor (or any other source code editor of your choice). It is one of the finest code editors available, offering a highly pleasant programming experience.

## Lessons Learned

I learned about the following :
- How to use an addEventListener() method in JS? (click)
- How to use setTimeout() method in JS?
- How to use Date Object in JS?

## Optimizations

I use these VS code extensions to support my development workflow.

1. esbenp.prettier-vscode
2. formulahendry.auto-close-tag
3. dbaeumer.jshint
4. xabikos.javascriptsnippets
5. ritwickdey.LiveServer

I also have used a little amount of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) in the Frontend.
